When I first start discovering the world of HTML, I found that this is quite an easy language to learn, but compare to all the fancy beautiful websites out there, my page just like a plain document that fills with letters. Is very important to have a clear and nice website so the viewer can easily access what they want but not just black and white letters. Although we can have CSS to make our website looks better, but it takes lots of time and effort for me to create the page exactly the way that I want it to be looks like, just like when you trying to dress up somebody, you have to begin with the material that makes the cloth, and what color you want to dye it with, and how you want to sew to make the cloth wearable. As we can tell that this is a very time-consuming job for web designers, fortunately, there are lots of UI frameworks that provide for us to easily dress up our website.

Why UI Frameworks?


Even though UI frameworks could take lots of time to master on it, but it is definitely worth to spend. Basically, UI frameworks set of class and interface that has been defined in which you can class these predefined classes to build your website. For example, the UI framework I used called Semantic UI, it gives lots of basic elements that make a website nicer, such as menu, grid, padding of images, icons, and more. When you trying to make a menu on top of your page, you can just simply call a div class with “ui menu” and it will automatically create a simple menu for you, which you can save lots of time from creating the menu from CSS, furthermore, you can choose the style of menu that you want to use, by just simply add the interface that they define in the class, such as add “boardless” in front of the menu, it’s going to remove all the line in the menu, which it’s a very flexible that you can create what you need on your website.

What I earn

By using UI frameworks, you can save lots of time once you master it. Whenever you need to create a website, by using the UI framework can increase work efficiency, you can turn a few hours work into a few minutes. Also, it is very easy to debug by using UI framework, since its very common, you can find lots of community that explain how this UI framework, whenever you have trouble with some element, you can easily solve the problem by just search up the element, it is also another way that increases your work efficiency. Instead of dressing your website from scratch, we can just choose the right cloth that’s already been made from other, which is the UI framework.
