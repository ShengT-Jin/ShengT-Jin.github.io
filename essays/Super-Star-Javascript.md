Ever since that I become an ICS student, I’ve never touch javascript before I took this course but after learning javascript from the first module, I’m completely into this programming language. Compare to the programming language that I use before, which is java and C, javascript has a simpler data structure that is much easier to use than Java and C, such as type of value, in java, there is byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char, but in javascript, a value can be assigned to anything, you only have to care about is the accessibility of a value. Also the uses of function, regularly in java or c, we have to mention what type of answer we are returning in a function, but in javascript, a function can be return with any type of answer, which javascript have less boundary to write code. Especially, one unique data type call object, this data type makes things easier when it has lots date, we can access them easily with an object data type.

In my opinion, javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. First, it is an extremely simple language to learn with. Compare to other programming languages, javascript offers a more similar syntax that is very close to  English, which people are more willing to learn and use since is very easy to start with. Furthermore, javascript offer all capability for the programming language, such as all the loop condition, checking, and use it to create and execute on the website, you can literally write a program in few minutes, and there is no complex compilation need.
  
Wants to be good at programming, the most important thing we need to practice. No matter what language you learn, more practice just going to make you a better programmer. After the few class from this course, I found out that WOD is a very efficacy way to practice solving problems, it gives you the question that can appear in many situations when you writing codes, and after you solve the problem, when next time you face the problem again, you can solve it faster and more efficiently. As an ICS student, I think this style of learning coding is very efficient since our job is to solve the problem, the more practice we take, the more experience you will gain that help us build up the ability to handle the problem. The process of learning coding might be stressful and difficult, but I believe it’s going to return more to myself in the future.
