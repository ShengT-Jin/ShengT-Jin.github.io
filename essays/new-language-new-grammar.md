When you learning a new language, you are not only learning the words, but also the grammar that puts words together and forms a complete sentence with its meaning. Without grammar, we won’t be able to understand the meaning of a sentence if they just randomly put words together. The same rules apply to code, this is what we called coding standards. The coding standard exists in every coding language, is very important to follow the rule because it narrows down the error you might be made and also gives you a clean, nice code so people will able to read, understand your code better.

## Helps you learn faster
Coding Standard is very important such that is going to improve your coding ability. When you just start learning a language, you often make a small typo or syntax errors, which sometimes it won’t boarder you to run the code, but it increases the chance of creates a bug. The coding standard I used called ESlint, it really helps a lot for me to understand javascript. For example, when I create a variable and didn’t use it, ESlint will underline this variable and tell that this is not been used, so I can go back delete the variable to make my coding clean. Also when I call a variable as let, since I’m not sure if it going be modify later on, after I finish everything, ESlint will remind me that to used const since the variable has not been modifying in another way. Furthermore, it helps me format my code by underline where I should add space and where I should remove the space, which it helps people easier to read when they helping me to debug or grade my code.

## What I earn
By using ESlint, it really gives me a lot of information and knowledge when I type code. It’s like a common grammar that all programmers need to learn and use to reach a higher standard of coding. Not only helping me with learning languages but also create an environment that all the programmer be able to work together, which we can understand each other’s code.
